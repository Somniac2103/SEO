Strategies:
1. Create them- add backlinks on directories, blog comments and social media profile. Easy but ineffective.

link rel Attribute: 
nofollow = google will not transfer authoritity throuth these links.
UGC = User generated content.  may past authortive if seem relevant.

2. robots.txt: Should be on your root domain. 
can have multiple robots.txt for sub domains.
robots.txt directives:
User-agent : Defines the crawler that the rule applies to
Disallow: Instructs user agents not to crawl specific pages or directories
3. Sitemaps: is a list the imporatnat URLS on your website. can be pages, images, videos, and other files.
can add sitemap directives in your robots.txt file.

----------TECHNICAL SEO FOR DEVELOPERS----------

-----1. User experience-----

1.1 Core Web Vitals
-Core pass mark works on the 75% percentile  so more than 3/4
-Device types are measure seperately. However, google works on the mobile first as indexing.

1.1.1 Largest Contentful Paint(LCP)- Largest thing loaded
-Visual load
-Is the largest element loaded in the viewport
-Recommended target LCP load within 2 (good) to 4 Needs improvement sec.
-check at the bottom to see what is the LCP element.
-4 most common causes:
 1. Slow server responses
 2. Render-blocking javascript and css
 3. Slow resource load times
 4. Client-side rendering

-Optimizing the rendering process:
 Images
 1. Lazyload
 2. Compress
 3. Preloading (Tells browsers what you want to load first)

 *If you don't use image CDN must save multiple copies at different resolutions.
 <img src="small.jpg" srcset="small.jpg 500w, medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 1500w" alt="â€¦">

 Preload tag informs browser about critical resource asap before their are discovered by HTML.
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="important.png">

Repsonsive images + Preload
In header: 
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="wolf.jpg" imagesrcset="wolf_400px.jpg 400w, wolf_800px.jpg 800w, wolf_1600px.jpg 1600w" imagesizes="50vw">
In body:
<img src="wolf.jpg" srcset="wolf_400px.jpg 400w, wolf_800px.jpg 800w, wolf_1600px.jpg 1600w" sizes="50vw" alt="A rad wolf">

Preloading background images using image-set:
*can set in CSS
background-image: image-set( "cat.png" 1x, "cat-2x.png" 2x);
<link rel="preload" as="image" imagesrcset="cat.png 1x, cat-2x.png 2x">

Preconnect to required origins
<link rel="preconnect">
Preconnect or dns-prefetch
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com">
*be careful as if you do not use the connection within 10 seconds the connection is severed and it is wasted resources.

<link rel="preload"> *for general use
<link rel="preconnect"> *for edge causes

<link rel="dns-prefetch"> this handles dnslookup 
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://example.com" />.



 CSS
 1. Minification
 2. inline your critical CSS for above the fold content.
  ->Website font
  ->ViewPort settings
  ->Background color
  ->H1 style
 3. Remove unused CSS (Devtool command) and defer non-critical CSS

 JS 
 1. Minify (But check it doesn't break)
 2. Remove non-critical JS
 3. Defer or asynchronously load JS
  -> <script defer src="js" </script> *all non critical js
  -> <script async src="js" </script> *for content needed earlier in page

1.1.2 First Input Delay (FID)- Time from load to being interactive.
-Interactivity
-Recommended speed for FID is Less than 100ms good then needs improvement from 100ms to 300ms

Types of interactions:
-Clicking a link or a button
-Inputting text into a blank friend
-Selecting a drop-down menu

Common cause for long FID is heavy javascript usage.
FID Optimisation:
1. Break up long tasks
2. Optimize your page for interaction readiness
3. USe a web worker
4. Reduce Javascript execution time

1.1.3 Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) - How much does the page shift around while loading.
-Visual stability
-Recommended CLS is 0.1(good) to 0.25(needs improvement)
- Most common causes of CLS
 1. Images without dimensions
 2. Ads,embeds and iframes without dimensions
 3. Dynamically injected content
 4. Fonts or styles applied too late in the code

Images:
  -Add Height and width Attributes or use CSS aspect ratio boxes
For ads, embeds and iframes:
  -Define height and width attributes for element 


1.2 Optimise Images
*Affects LCP
-Responsive images for different screen sizes
-Use most modern format for the browsers can user (webp and avif)
- Use lowest resolutions as possible for screen sizesrcset = " small-image.png 300w, medium-image.png 600w, large-image.png 1200w"
-Lazyload offscreen images always
-set height and width for images *CLS 
-compress image lossly if quality is not important and lossless if quality is important.
*Use a tool to optimise images.

1.3 Accessbility
- Alt text on images
- semantics elements

1.4 Mobile responsiveness
-Mobile First
- Viewport meta tag: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
-readability font for all devices

1.5 Reduce Javascript as far as possible
-check bundler pack size 
-check pixels and tracker tag
-do not require JS for critical functionality
-Prerender aka server side rednering website

1.6 Clean URL structure
-USe short, descriptive , keyword URL

<title> </title>
<meta name="description" content=" seo description"/>
must must be unqie for each page and post.

2.2 XML Sitemap

- The formats does change qualtity like Lossy(tradeoff between quality and size)while loseless only compress as far as quality remains.
- Use compression on all images
-Quality factor 0.75 is commonly used.
-good cache policy for images
-Use CDN
-Correctly sequencing images: 
1. Large hero image above the fold, 
2. all smaller images above the fold, 
3. images just off screen so when scrolling happends,
4. lazy load everything else.
* <img loading="lazy"...

HTTP2 
Push images to webssite that will be needed.

-----Javascript -----
Tip 1: Avoid JS file proliferation
Avoid having too many JS files as overhead per file increase load time
Keep request counts low and files sizes low
Combine JS files and load syncronousliy 
Use HTTP2 where possible. Bigger highway

Tip 2: Avoid excessive DNS lookups
Avoid loading too files from too many different sites.
Try to hold a local copy of the files needed.
Some popular libraries may already be in the user cache due to frequent use.

Tip 3: Eliminate inefficient JS
Too broad

Tip 4: Eliminate unused Javascript
Only load JS files that is needed for the page.
Tree shaking to remove files not being used.

Tip 5: CompressJS files
Takes longer to process at client side however improves download speed which normally has a net benefit

Tip 6: Set Appropriate cahce duration for JS code
cache-control:max-age=604800
Check serve assets with an efficient cache policy
Insure that cache refreshes is done when needed.
possible work around is providing library versions.
and use js which has been used before.

-----Mobile Friendly -----
Use Reponsive web design

Design for mobile index.

make sure content doesn't spill off the viewing port
Ensure text is large enough to read comfortably
ensure users can zoom in on content if they want a closer lookingEnsure buttons icons are large enough to be easily recognizable

Usability: 
Make sure structure is not hard to use.
Make sure the site is one had operable and interactive component easily clickable.
Relaying too much on keyboard inputs.
use mobile friendly test on search.google.com/test/mobility-friendly

Peronalisation for mobile
less real estate so better use of the space to perosnalized
use cookies

Utilized mobile input feature:
pinch and swipe
location services
voice input 
augmented reality
images searches
*can use JS to detect avaiable features and only support those.
